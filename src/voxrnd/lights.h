   @brief Light manager

   The light manager which supports a few types of light. This manager operates
   with color as with floating point triplet (of type `vox_dot`). The first
   number is amount of red, the second is amount of green and the third is
   amount of blue. Accepted range is [0, 1], zero meaning "null intensity" and
   one meaning "full intensity".
